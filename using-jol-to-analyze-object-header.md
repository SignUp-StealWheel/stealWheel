# [JOL (Java Object Layout)](https://github.com/openjdk/jol/blob/master/README.md)
> JOL (Java Object Layout) is the tiny toolbox to analyze object layout
in JVMs. These tools are using Unsafe, JVMTI, and Serviceability Agent (SA)
heavily to decode the actual object layout, footprint, and references.
This makes JOL much more accurate than other tools relying on heap dumps,
specification assumptions, etc.
